# research-topic

Answer discovery questions over the vault by chaining MCP tools — not by grepping files directly. The MCP tools use Obsidian's metadata cache, so they return structured results (frontmatter, tags, link graph) that raw reads can't.

## When to use

- "What do my notes say about X?"
- "Summarize my thinking on X."
- "Find all notes that discuss X and how they connect."
- Any question that needs both content retrieval *and* relational context.

## Do not use

- Single-file lookups (just call `vault_context` directly).
- Write-side tasks (see `link-hygiene` or `reviewed-edit`).

## Tool chain

1. **`vault_search`** with the topic as query, `limit: 20`. This gives you the candidate set of relevant notes with a snippet per match.
2. **Rank by signal.** Prefer notes whose title matches the topic, then notes with matching tags or frontmatter. Pull tags/frontmatter with `vault_tags` (topic as tag) or `vault_properties` if the user's vault uses structured metadata.
3. **`vault_context`** on the 3–5 highest-signal hits. Each call returns content + frontmatter + tags + headings + outgoing links + backlinks in one shot. **Do not** call `vault_read`, `vault_frontmatter`, `vault_links`, `vault_backlinks` separately — `vault_context` subsumes them.
4. **`vault_graph_neighborhood`** at `depth: 1–2` on the single most-linked note from step 3 to find adjacent notes the search may have missed (e.g. notes that link to it but don't mention the keyword).
5. **Optional:** `vault_backlinks` on a key note if you specifically need who cites it.

## Synthesis rules

- Cite note paths inline (e.g. `notes/foo.md`) so the user can jump to them.
- If hits disagree, surface the disagreement — don't silently pick one.
- If the search returns nothing, do not fabricate. Say "no notes matched" and ask the user for adjacent terms — `vault_suggest_links` requires a starting `file` so it can't help here.

## Example

User: "What do I have on distributed systems consensus?"

```
1. vault_search(query="consensus", limit=20)
   → 7 hits, top: notes/raft.md, notes/paxos.md, notes/fl-impossibility.md
2. vault_context(path="notes/raft.md")  // most backlinks in the snippet
3. vault_context(path="notes/paxos.md")
4. vault_context(path="notes/fl-impossibility.md")
5. vault_graph_neighborhood(path="notes/raft.md", depth=2)
   → notes/replication.md, notes/byzantine.md (not in search hits)
6. vault_context(path="notes/replication.md")
```

Then synthesize: "Three primary notes cover consensus — Raft (notes/raft.md), Paxos (notes/paxos.md), and the FL impossibility result (notes/fl-impossibility.md). Your Raft note links out to replication and byzantine-fault-tolerance …"
