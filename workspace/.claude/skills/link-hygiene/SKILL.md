# link-hygiene

Periodic vault cleanup: broken links, orphans, and missed cross-references. Always preview before writing.

## When to use

- "Clean up my vault."
- "Find broken links."
- "What notes aren't connected to anything?"
- "Suggest links for my recent notes."

## Constraints

- Writes to the vault outside `$OAS_VAULT_WRITE_DIR` require the `writeReviewed` tier; each change will pop a diff modal. If the tier isn't enabled, suggest changes only.
- Never mass-delete. Orphan status is a hint, not a verdict.
- Show the user a summary (counts + sample) before applying any batch change.

## Tool chain

### Phase 1 — Inventory (read-only)

1. **`vault_unresolved`** — list every broken wikilink and its source file.
2. **`vault_orphans`** — notes with no links in or out.
3. **`vault_recent`** with `limit: 20` — recently-modified notes are the likeliest candidates for missed links.

Summarize counts and show the user before acting.

### Phase 2 — Fix broken links

For each unresolved link, decide:
- **Typo?** Use `vault_search_replace` on the source file with the corrected wikilink.
- **Missing note the user wants?** Create it via `vault_create` (inside `$OAS_VAULT_WRITE_DIR`) with a stub (`# Title\n\n(placeholder)`), then the wikilink resolves.
- **Stale reference?** Use `vault_search_replace` to remove the wikilink.

Never decide silently — present the user with `{source, broken_link, proposed_action}` and wait for confirmation on ambiguous cases.

### Phase 3 — Suggest new links

For each recent note (from step 3):
1. **`vault_suggest_links`** with `limit: 5`.
2. Filter suggestions — drop low-score hits; drop anything that would create a circular reference that isn't meaningful.
3. Present the list; on approval, insert `[[target]]` wikilinks via `vault_search_replace` (find the anchor phrase, add the link) or `vault_patch` (insert after a specific heading).

### Phase 4 — Surface orphans (no action)

List orphans grouped by folder. Ask the user whether any should be linked from an index note, archived, or deleted. Never delete without explicit per-file confirmation.

## Batching

If applying many changes, do them one file at a time with review on — don't batch across files into a single modal, since the user needs per-change context.

## Example output to user

```
Link hygiene report for the vault:
- 12 broken wikilinks across 7 files
- 23 orphan notes
- 4 recent notes have 2+ high-confidence link suggestions

Proceeding with broken links first. Fix plan for notes/foo.md:
  [[consensus-algo]] → typo? did you mean [[consensus-algorithm]]? (file exists)

Apply this fix? (y/n)
```
